Face and Eye detection is an Artificial Intelligence (AI) based computer technology used to find and identify human eye in digital images.The detection of a personâ€™s eyes is a basic task in applications as important as iris recognition  in current commercial and research systems use software frameworks that require a dedicated computer, whose power consumption, size and price are significantly large. We are here now, using the techniques of computer vision in open cv to build this project. 
Image processing and computer vision creation of framework to detect driver fatigue eye features. The algorithm used in this paper localizes the eye region and detects its state on the basis of rough to precise thinking, it can accurately locate eye pupils in an eye-open state, which is critical for reducing traffic accidents.
