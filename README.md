Face and Eye detection is an Artificial Intelligence (AI) based computer technology used to find and identify the human eye in digital images. The detection of a person’s eyes is a basic task in applications as important as iris recognition  in current commercial and research systems that use software frameworks that require a dedicated computer, whose power consumption, size, and price are significantly large. We are here now, using the techniques of computer vision in open cv to build this project. 
Image processing and computer vision creation of a framework to detect driver fatigue eye features. The algorithm used in this paper localizes the eye region and detects its state based on rough to precise thinking, it can accurately locate eye pupils in an eye-open state, which is critical for reducing traffic accidents.

OpenCV  is an image processing library for python. It is the most popular library for image processing and computer vision tasks because it is open source and very fast. OpenCV contains more than 2500 image processing algorithms. Approximate 70% of the industry uses OpenCV for their image processing application


ALGORITHMS : HAAR CASCADE CLASSIFIER

The Haar cascade classifier is an effective way to detect various objects in the surroundings. This method is also used in detection of face and eyes. The main objective of the Haar cascade classifier is a collection of a lot of positive images and negative images which are later on to train the classifier. Positive images are the images that you want our classifier to identity and negative images are images of everything they don’t want our classifier to detect.
